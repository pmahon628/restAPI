# restAPI
Rest API with Node Express and Mongo.

Simple but important project. I have spent alot time working on front-end projects and because  of that I am certain that my backend skills are lacking.  

This is intented to be a simple REST API utulizing Node, Express, and Mongo. I also used Postman for testing purposes.

Thank you.
